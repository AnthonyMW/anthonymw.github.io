      <p>You can click on the Game Text that is underlined colored White to be able to play Get To School, a nice game that is about getting to school fighting off many evil cretures and other bad things that walk around the world. You can even be able to collect POGS to be able to get special weapons that make you go much, much faster in battle. Fight off the evil to be able to get to class in time. Or you can click on the About text that is also underlined and also Whited. That will bring you to another HTML page that talks about Anthony Watson, aka the creator, aka me, and you would be able to see what I am, and what am I doing in life. It also uses the same CSS and the same Java Script as this HTML website. So go on and look around the pages.</p>
