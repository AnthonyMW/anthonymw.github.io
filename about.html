        <p>This is me, a Freshman in York Tech. My name is Anthony M. Watson and I'm in I.T. . Throughout the first year here I was able to make knowledge about the field and learn about the Software of computers and the Hardware of them. Then I was able to learn the Networking/ Cyber security of them, and of how to be able to Program and be able to make websites which I have in this HTML webpage. I also was able to make Vitrual Machines, aka Software Computers that can do everything a normal computer do, but better. I was even able to learn and improve my own PC I have at my house and learn about the parts of a computer from Hardware class. And then, finally I was able to improve my security for my router and Computer at home, and my the internet connection strogner at my house from learning all about it from Networking/Cybersecurity class. I love being able to Program and I hope in the Future I would be able to learn more about Java script and Python from Junior and Senior years. I can't wait for the Future of my Life in this Amazing School, and I can't wait to learn more about Computer Programming.</p>
